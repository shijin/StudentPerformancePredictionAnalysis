# Predicting Student Performance and Risk of Failure using Data Analytics and Machine Learning

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting student performance using SQL, Power BI, and Python. The goal is to help schools identify at-risk students early and provide proactive support.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- Students (demographics, family, income, etc.)
- Attendance
- Exam Scores
- Activities
- Disciplinary Records
- Teachers
- Classes

## ðŸ”Ž Analysis
- SQL analysis for trends (exam results, attendance, discipline).
- Power BI dashboards for visualization.

## ðŸ¤– Predictive Modeling
Two scenarios:
1. SQL Pipeline for Modeling Strategy
2. With Past Scores â†’ Perfect prediction but risk of data leakage.
3. Without Past Scores â†’ Weak predictive power, highlights data gaps.

## ðŸ“Š Results
- Past exam scores are the best predictors.
- Without scores, other features were insufficient to predict failures.
- Models tested: Random Forest, XGBoost.

## âœ… Recommendations
- Use past scores for reliable predictions.
- Collect more continuous assessment data.
- Use dashboards for real-time monitoring.
- Focus on early interventions.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- SQL (Snowflake)
- Power BI | [Dashboard](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNWUzMWQxMTctZTZhMy00MTEyLTg3NzMtZjBjMGU0YjUzNGFmIiwidCI6IjY5NTYyNmRmLWQxMTctNDI3OC1iMzdkLTEyNTJlNGZkOGIwNyJ9)
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost)
